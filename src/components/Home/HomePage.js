          Developed as part of the CS385 Mobile Application Development course
          at Maynooth University, Project Olympus Mons is a testament to the
          power of technology in promoting sustainable environmental practices.
          Created by a team of four dedicated students - Firose, Ã‰anna, Patrick,
          and Audrius, this app empowers individuals to understand and reduce
          their carbon footprint.

          Embracing the course theme of "A Sustainable Environment", our
          application offers a unique platform to track and visualize the
          environmental impact of daily transport choices. By opting for walking
          over car travel, users can see real-time data on how much carbon
          emissions they save, fostering a sense of responsibility and
          motivation towards eco-friendly habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project represents a significant part of our course grade,
          reflecting our commitment to applying theoretical knowledge in a
          practical, impactful manner. We chose React JavaScript for its
          versatility and support, coupled with MongoDB for efficient data
          management, and utilised various APIs like Google Fit user-specific
          data collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collaborative coding and version control were managed through GitHub,
          enhancing teamwork and productivity. Our repository{" "}
